<h1><i>Shroinger's Cat</i> by Robert Anton Wilson</h1>
<br>
<p> This may be melodramatic, but I genuinely think that <i>Shrodinger’s Cat</i> is one of the most unapprecieted books I’ve ever read. It’s author Robert Anton Wilson is definitely well known, but mostl for the Illuminatus Trilogy, which he wrote with Robert Shea.
	I think that the two biggest reasons that this book hasn’t caught on more is because it deals with sex and sexuality in a very lurid way and also because its subject matter is just overall very silly. Wilson was the founder of Discordianism, and the book celebrates absurdity at every page. It’s too bad that that’s held it back though, because Wilson isn’t writing smut, or some pretentious meaningless screaming taboo for it’s own sake book like Naked Lunch. </p> </br>
  <p>The book actually has very concrete themes and a central point. The point Wilson is trying to make is that humans are animals struggling to create a meaningful narrative out of the small facet of the universe we see. Our intelligence can help us to make narratives that truly reflect reality, but our preconceived notions of the universe, both instinctive and sociological, can just as easily lead to us believing false narratives. It’s the constant job of the individual to learn and question as much as possible to form as accurate a picture of reality as they can, while keeping in mind that they can never truly succeed. Wilson once called himself an “everything agnostic”. He also uses the book as a means to explore his ideas for society, often framed in absurdly extreme ways. And along the way he manages to do some really innovative things with the structure of the novel. Wilson plays with metafiction; he is a minor side character in the novel and several characters are aware that they are in a book. Sometimes this serves as a metaphor to drive home the point about humans living in our own constantly self constructed reality bubbles, but it’s just as often just put there so Wilson can play around with prose and formula. Because above all, this book is fun, Wilsons delight in wordplay and thinking about thinking crackles off the page.    </p>

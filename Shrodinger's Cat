<h1><i>Shroinger's Cat</i> by Robert Anton Wilson</h1>
<br>
<p> This may be melodramatic, but I genuinely think that <i>Shrodinger’s Cat</i> is one of the most unapprecieted books I’ve ever read. Its author Robert Anton Wilson is definitely well known, but mostl for the Illuminatus! Trilogy, which he wrote with Robert Shea. 
	I think that the two biggest reasons that this book hasn’t caught on more is because it deals with sex and sexuality in a very lurid way and also because its subject matter is just overall very silly. Wilson was the founder of Discordianism, and the book celebrates absurdity at every page. It’s too bad that that’s held it back though, because Wilson isn’t writing smut, or some pretentious meaningless screaming taboo for it’s own sake book like Naked Lunch. </p> </br>
  <p>The book actually has very concrete themes and a central point. The point Wilson is trying to make is that humans are animals struggling to create a meaningful narrative out of the small facet of the universe we see. Our intelligence can help us to make narratives that truly reflect reality, but our preconceived notions of the universe, both instinctive and sociological, can just as easily lead to us believing false narratives. It’s the constant job of the individual to learn and question as much as possible to form as accurate a picture of reality as they can, while keeping in mind that they can never fully succeed. Wilson once called himself an “everything agnostic”. He also uses the book as a means to explore his ideas for society, often framed in absurdly extreme ways. And along the way he manages to do some really innovative things with the structure of the novel. Wilson plays with metafiction; he is a minor side character in the novel and several characters are aware that they are in a book. Sometimes this serves as a metaphor to drive home the point about humans living in our own constantly self constructed reality bubbles, but it’s just as often just put there so Wilson can play around with prose and formula. Because above all, this book is fun, Wilsons delight in wordplay and thinking about thinking crackles off the page.    </p>
  <p> At the same time though, Wilson deals with some very serious topics. The novel is very ahead of its time in terms of politics; a lot of the ideas he discusses in it are just becoming popular in the last few years. <i>Shrodinger's Cat</i> is definitely the first exposure I had to the idea of universal basic income. Andrew Yang recently pushed the topic into the mainstream, and the interesting thing is that, underneath the exerageted absurdity of the book, they're really making the exact same points. In his book, Wilson argues that many jobs are on the cusp of automation, and that something has to be done to keep the masses from starving. He even responds to a common critisism of UBI pretty much the same way that Yang did in his campaign. Many people argue that UBI would squash inovation and excellence by eliminating any need to work hard. Wilson depicts people instead turning towards aquiring skills to let them do the few jobs still left. Now that they are freed from the daily gring of their monotonous jobs, they have the time and resources to build towards their true potential.       </p>
